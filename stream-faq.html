        <h2>Stream FAQ</h2>
        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>This is where you can find the answers to a bunch of questions you might have running through your head while you watch my stream!</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What kind of game are you making?</h3>
        <p>I'm making a 2D Top-Down Action-Adventure game (with some RPG elements mixed in there). I know that's a bit much so let me break
            it down for you.
            <ul>
                <li>It'll be a top-down 2D game, not a platformer. This means that the camera is above the player and you can move up, down, left, right, and diagonally.</li>
                <li>An action-adventure game basically means that all combat will happen in real time. There are no battle scenes or anything like that. When you see an enemy,
                    you attack it and defeat it (or it defeats you!).</li>
                <li>The RPG elements will probably come in the form of leveling up weapons, magic, and other powerups.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What programming languages / libraries / tools will you be using?</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Programming language: </strong>C++</li>
                <li><strong>Libraries: </strong>SDL2 / OpenGL</li>
                <li><strong>Tools: </strong>CLion IDE, Tiled map editor, Photoshop</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What is the theme of this game?</h3>
        <p>
            I really like this question and enjoy answering it. Ever since I started making games, I've had a certain idea for a game I want to create and I finally have the
            opportunity to do so.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are two main themes in this game:
            <ul>
                <li>Dreams</li>
                <li>Time</li>
            </ul>
            My goal when creating games is to evoke as much emotion from the player as possible. I believe that a great game is one that you <em>feel</em> for awhile
            after playing it. Both of these themes, when used properly, have the ability to do exactly this.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Why are you streaming the development of this game on Twitch?</h3>
        <p>
            One of the major reasons I am streaming the development of this game on Twitch is for the interaction with all of you. As a game developer, my goal is to get my game
            into as many hands as possible. I want everyone to have the experience that I am creating. Twitch is a great way to accomplish this.
            <br /><br />
            Another reason is that it gives <em>you</em> a way to interact with <em>me</em>. I can answer any questions you have related to programming, game development, or anything else.
            I also think it's great to get to know everyone who is interested in my games, so please come say hi!
        </p>

        <h3>Do you accept donations?</h3>
        <p>
            As a matter of fact, I do!
            <br /><br />
            I make games because I love making games. Unfortunately, however, money is a very real factor in my life. Any donations I receive go directly towards bills, my future wedding, and of course
            improving the stream.
            <br /><br />
            You are in no way obligated to donate. Simply watching the stream is support that I appreciate very much. Donations do keep things moving along, however, so I am very grateful
            for anything you send my way.
            <br /><br />
            As always, any donation amount is greatly appreciated and helps out very much, so thank you.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Anything else?</h3>
        <p>You tell me! Let me know when I'm streaming if you have any more questions. I'll add to this FAQ if many people are wondering the same things!
            <br /><br />
            Thank you all so much for your support and I can't wait to see how this game turns out!
        </p>
